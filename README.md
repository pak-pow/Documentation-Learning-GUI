# Documentation-Learning-GUI

Welcome to **Documentation-Learning-GUI**, a centralized repository where I document my journey learning different GUI frameworks—starting with Kivy. The goal of this repo is twofold:

1. **Study and record** my progress step by step.  
2. **Build sample apps** that will be useful for my personal projects.

- **learning_kivy/**  
  Contains all resources for my Kivy learning path—PDFs, code snippets, demo apps, and instructions.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the root README** to understand the overall scope and next steps.  
2. **Enter the `learning_kivy/` folder** to see Kivy-specific material (tutorial PDFs, sample code, etc.).  
3. **Follow along** with each day’s notes and code as you study GUI development in Kivy.

## 📚 Why Kivy?

- **Cross-platform**: Write once in Python, run on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.  
- **Open-source**: Active community, lots of learning resources, and flexibility to tailor interfaces.  
- **Widget-based**: Intuitive to build screens, layouts, and interactions.

---

## 📝 Future Plans

- Add more daily-learning PDFs (`learning_kivy_day2.pdf`, `learning_kivy_day3.pdf`, …).  
- Create small demo apps (e.g., a to-do list, a simple game, or a calculator).  
- Document pitfalls, installation tips, and performance tweaks.  
- Eventually explore other GUI frameworks (e.g., PyQt5, Tkinter) in separate folders.

## 🤝 Contributing / Feedback

- If you spot an error or have suggestions (typos, better examples, additional resources), feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.  
- This is my personal learning repo, so most changes will come from my own notes, but community insights are always welcome!

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites (for any subfolder with code)

- **Python 3.7+** installed on your system.  
- Basic familiarity with Python and command-line usage.  
- For Kivy-specific content, follow the instructions in `learning_kivy/README.md`.
