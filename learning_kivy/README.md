# Learning Kivy

This folder contains all my notes, examples, and progress files as I learn **Kivy**, a Python framework for building cross‚Äêplatform GUI applications. My goal is to develop small, practical apps that can later be adapted for real‚Äêworld projects.

## üéØ Goals

1. **Understand Kivy fundamentals**  
   - Widgets, layouts, properties, and events.
2. **Build simple demo apps**  
   - Learn how to structure a Kivy project with `.py` files and `.kv` files.
3. **Document every step**  
   - Keep a running log (PDFs, code snippets, screenshots) so I can refer back later.
4. **Apply to real projects**  
   - Once comfortable, adapt Kivy code into small utilities for my other Python projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have:

1. **Python 3.7+** installed.  
2. **Kivy** installed (recommend using a virtual environment). To install Kivy:

   ```
   python3 -m venv kivy_env
   source kivy_env/bin/activate    # (macOS/Linux)
   # or
   kivy_env\Scripts\activate.bat   # (Windows)

   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   pip install kivy
   ```

3. **A PDF reader** (to view the day-by-day notes).

## üìñ Day 1: learning_kivy_day1.pdf

**Topics covered:**

- Installing Kivy in a virtual environment  
- Writing a minimal `main.py` that launches a Kivy window  
- Using basic Widgets (Label, Button, BoxLayout)  
- Introduction to `.kv` language for separating UI from Python logic

**How to view:**

- Open `learning_kivy_day1.pdf` in your favorite PDF viewer.  
- Follow the step-by-step annotated screenshots and code blocks.

## üìñ **Day 2: learning_kivy_day#2.pdf**  

**Topics covered:**

- Deeper understanding of the `.kv` language and its role in separating UI from logic  
- Creating a clean form layout using nested `GridLayout`s  
- Connecting UI elements (`Button`, `TextInput`) from the `.kv` file to Python functions  
- Exploring widget properties like `id`, `text`, and `multiline`

**Highlights:**

- Successfully created a simple input form with fields for Name, Age, and Email  
- Linked the **Submit** button to a Python method using `on_press`  
- Realized how straightforward and fun it is to connect design to functionality in Kivy

**How to view:**

- Open `learning_kivy_day#2.pdf` in your favorite PDF reader  
- See layout structure, code examples, and notes on `.kv` file behavior and UI wiring
