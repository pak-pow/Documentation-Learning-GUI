# Learning Kivy

This folder contains all my notes, examples, and progress files as I learn **Kivy**, a Python framework for building cross‐platform GUI applications. My goal is to develop small, practical apps that can later be adapted for real‐world projects.

  Day 1 notes: installation steps, basic widget demos, and first “Hello, Kivy!” app.  
  (Open with any PDF reader.)

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Understand Kivy fundamentals**  
   - Widgets, layouts, properties, and events.
2. **Build simple demo apps**  
   - Learn how to structure a Kivy project with `.py` files and `.kv` files.
3. **Document every step**  
   - Keep a running log (PDFs, code snippets, screenshots) so I can refer back later.
4. **Apply to real projects**  
   - Once comfortable, adapt Kivy code into small utilities for my other Python projects.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before diving in, make sure you have:

1. **Python 3.7+** installed.  
2. **Kivy** installed (recommend using a virtual environment). To install Kivy:

   ```
   python3 -m venv kivy_env
   source kivy_env/bin/activate    # (macOS/Linux)
   # or
   kivy_env\Scripts\activate.bat   # (Windows)

   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   pip install kivy
   ```

3. **A PDF reader** (to view the day-by-day notes).

**Topics covered:**

- Installing Kivy in a virtual environment  
- Writing a minimal `main.py` that launches a Kivy window  
- Using basic Widgets (Label, Button, BoxLayout)  
- Introduction to `.kv` language for separating UI from Python logic

**How to view:**

- Open `learning_kivy_day1.pdf` in your favorite PDF viewer.  
- Follow the step-by-step annotated screenshots and code blocks.

## 🚧 Upcoming Content

- **Day 2 PDF**: Advanced layouts (GridLayout, AnchorLayout, FloatLayout)  
- **Sample Code**: I’ll add small Python script examples (`.py` and `.kv` files) as I build them.  
- **Mini Projects**: A to-do list app, a simple image gallery, and possibly a Tic-Tac-Toe game (leveraging what I learned).
