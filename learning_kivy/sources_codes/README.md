# 🧠 Source Codes – Learning Kivy

This folder contains all the sample source code files created during my Kivy learning journey. These examples correspond to the concepts and layouts explored in my day-by-day PDF documentation.

---

## 📁 Folder Purpose

Each `.py` and `.kv` file in this directory is tied to a specific lesson, topic, or experiment I've worked on—ranging from simple widget demos to complete layout structures using the Kivy framework.

---

## 📦 Contents Overview

Typical files you’ll find here:

- **Python logic files** (`.py`) – These contain the app logic, class definitions, and main program entry points.
- **Kivy layout files** (`.kv`) – These define the UI structure separately from the Python logic using Kivy’s language.

---

## 🧪 Example Topics Covered

- Basic app window setup with `App` and `build()`  
- Label, Button, and TextInput widgets  
- Form creation using `GridLayout`  
- Handling events like `on_press` from `.kv` to `.py`  
- Layout nesting and responsive UI positioning  
- Connecting `.kv` files with Python classes via naming conventions

---

## 🗂 File Naming Convention

- Files are named based on the topic or the day they were created (e.g., `main_day2_form.py`, `form_layout.kv`)  
- Some code is directly referenced or expanded upon in the day-by-day PDF files like `learning_kivy_day1.pdf`, `learning_kivy_day#2.pdf`, etc.

## 🚀 How to Run the Examples

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and Kivy installed.
2. Navigate to this folder in your terminal or code editor.
3. Run a file like so:

   ```
   python day#2.py
